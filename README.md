# 🟢 Green Lantern
Green Lantern is a simple mobile app built with React Native and Expo.
The main goal of this project is to practice and understand the usage of the `useState` hook.

### 📱 About the App

The app simulates a green lantern that can be turned on and off.

When the lantern is **activated**:
- The background color changes
- The image changes to represent the lantern turned on (green light)

When it is deactivated:
- The background returns to its default state
- The image changes back to the lantern turned off

All of this behavior is controlled using React's `useState`.

### 🚀 Technologies Used

- React Native
- Expo
- TypeScript (React Hooks)

### 🎯 Purpose

This project was created only for learning and testing purposes, focusing on:
- State management with `useState`
- Conditional rendering
- Basic styling changes based on state
